i O
slept O

avoid O
how O
i O
was O

after O

. O
i O
was O
only O
on O

it O
worked O
mentally O
but O
to O
this O
day O
, O
my O
gastro B-Disease
- I-Disease
intestinal I-Disease
system I-Disease
is I-Disease
screwed I-Disease
up I-Disease
. O
cymbalta O
has O
the O
same O
adverse O
side O
effects O
of O
the O
other O
ssri O
medications O
and O
then O
some O
. O
if O
that O
werent O
enough O
, O
it O
increases B-Disease
anxiety I-Disease
and O
thus O
has O
less O
value O
as O
an O
anti O
- O
depressant O
. O
yet O
what O
was O
even O
more O
profound O
, O
i O
found O
that O
i O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
emotional B-Disease
upset I-Disease
at I-Disease
all I-Disease
times I-Disease
but O

myself O

. O
to O
add O
to O
the O
constant B-Disease
emotional I-Disease
upset I-Disease
, O
i O
can O
now O
attribute O
cymbalta O
to O
frustrating B-Disease
memory I-Disease
lapses I-Disease

a B-Disease
dramatic I-Disease
compromise I-Disease
in I-Disease

the O
decreased B-Disease
appetite I-Disease
! O
weight B-Disease
gain I-Disease
, O
sexual B-Disease
side I-Disease
effects I-Disease
, O
extremely O
unhappy O
with O
all O
of O
these O
side O
effects O
. O
i O
feel O
somewhat O
more O
stable O
than O
when O
off O
of O
this O
type O
of O

, O
but O
i O
am O
also O
so O
unhappy O
with O
the O
long O
term O
side O
effects O
. O
also O
, O
i O
am O
still O
experiencing O
some O
major B-Disease
depressive I-Disease
episodes I-Disease
and O
invasive B-Disease
thoughts I-Disease
, O
which O
makes O
me O
question O
if O
the O
cure O
is O
worse O
than O
the O
disease O
. O
have O
gained B-Disease
30 I-Disease
lbs I-Disease
since O

my O
cholesterol B-Disease
has I-Disease
jumped I-Disease
up I-Disease
over O
50 O
points O
in O
the O
last O
year O

which O
can O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
cymbalta O
. O
very B-Disease
sleepy I-Disease
all I-Disease
the I-Disease
time I-Disease
. O
hard B-Disease
time I-Disease
focusing I-Disease
and O
if O
i O
miss O
dose O
look O
out O
. O
the O
drug O
has O
helped O
with O
the O
depression O
, O
however O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
awful O
. O
if O
you O
think O
giving O
a O
depressed O
woman O
who O
has O
never O
had O
a O
weight O
problem O
, O
an O
extra B-Disease
30 I-Disease
lbs I-Disease
to O
carry O
around O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
you O
would O
be O
mistaken O
. O
so O
mostly O
the O
weight B-Disease
issue I-Disease
is O
a O
big O
deal O
. O
i O
